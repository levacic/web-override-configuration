# Gmail tweaks

These are a few simple overrides to make the Gmail interface more usable, especially with a dark theme.

The `style.css` file is documented for why specific overrides are there and what they achieve.

The overrides need to be active on pages whos URLs match the RegExp `^https://mail.google.com/.*$`.
