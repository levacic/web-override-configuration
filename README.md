# Web Override configuration

These are backed up, versioned-controlled override configurations for the [Web Override](https://weboverride.com/) Chrome extension.

Unfortunately, it seems that this extension is [no longer available](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-override/lllllobkincmdnjfkbknjacacmnlajll), which seems to happen somewhat often with these kinds of extensions. Its source code is [still available](https://github.com/dcohenb/WebOverride), though, so it's possible to rebuild it manually if needed.

I still have it installed and am using it, however, I will probably be upgrading to something else at some point. In fact, I initially used Stylish for this purpose, but stopped using it after it became to spyware-ish for my taste. One extension I've seen mentioned in a few places is [Resource Override](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/resource-override/pkoacgokdfckfpndoffpifphamojphii), but even that seems to be in [maintenance mode](https://github.com/kylepaulsen/ResourceOverride), with the last update released over a year ago.

My primary use-case for this is just making some stuff more readable on Gmail, so that's the only tweak currently available.
